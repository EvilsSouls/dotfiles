# Qutebrowser

This is my configuration for Qutebrowser. Many of the configuration options are inspired by the options from [BreadOnPenguins's Dotfiles Repo](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins/dots).

## To-Do:

Somehow maybe add a keyboard shortcut to quickly translate a word. Is there perhaps a program for this? Also add more greasemonkey scripts and userscripts
