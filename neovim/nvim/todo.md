# To-Do

This is the todo for my neovim configuration.

- [x] Make colors not so obnoxious in markdown -> own plugin
- [x] Use Treesitter text objects
- [ ] Make context stay at the top of the screen
- [x] Figure out how completions should be triggered (Tab, Return, etc.)
- [x] Finish Completion sources
- [ ] Make Markdown easier to type (lists, checklists, etc.)
- [ ] Figure out LuaSnip and make LuaSnippets for latex in Markdown
- [x] Figure out why obsidian.nvim and obsidian-bridge isn't working
- [ ] Update LSP Capabilities and Keybinds (also TreeSitter)
- [ ] Add Which-Key configuration
- [ ] Change lualine to be more minimal when screen size is limited
- [ ] Nvim Tree
- [ ] Trouble Plugin

This is a test of the colors. The default regex that is used (in js notation) is: `/(-?\d+(\.\d+)?|\b\w+(-\w*)*)/g`

This is another test of the colors. \colors{red

\color{LightSkyBlue} orange
