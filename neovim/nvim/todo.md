# To-Do

This is the todo for my neovim configuration.

- [ ] Make colors not so obnoxious in markdown -> own plugin
- [ ] Use Treesitter text objects
- [ ] Make context stay at the top of the screen
- [ ] Figure out how completions should be triggered (Tab, Return, etc.)
- [ ] Finish Completion sources
- [ ] Make Markdown easier to type (lists, checklists, etc.)
- [ ] Figure out LuaSnip and make LuaSnippets for latex in Markdown
- [ ] Figure out why obsidian.nvim and obsidian-bridge isn't working
